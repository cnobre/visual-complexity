Thank you for your interest in joining a study about COVID-19 visualizations. The study is being run by Carolina Nobre from Harvard University. This page provides some information about the research. 

 

What is the goal of this study?

 

The goal is to look at whether static and animated visualizations showing COVID-19 data are easy to understand. The results will be used to create better public health messaging about COVID-19 through visualizations. 

 

What can I expect if I take part in this research? 

 

Your participation is entirely up to you, and you may stop at any time. If you choose to take part, you will answer questions about COVID-19 visualizations. The survey will be online and should take around 20 minutes to finish.

 

For each visualization, you will be asked to answer questions that gauge your understanding of the visualization.  

 

 

You will be required to finish the whole survey in a SINGLE SITTING, with no distractions. If you need more time to finish the survey, you can choose to take longer than 20 minutes, but you may be timed out by Prolific after around  50 minutes.

 

When taking the survey, you will not have any contact with members of the study team. All information collected will be maintained anonymously. Names and other identifying information, such as IP addresses, will not be saved. 

 

What should I know about the research study?

 
Whether or not you take part is up to you. You can choose not to take part. You can agree to take part and later change your mind. Your decision will not be held against you.

 

Participants who score within the top 15% will receive a bonus pay so please fill this out as accurately as you can.

 

Who can I talk to? 

 

If you have questions, concerns, or a problem, please reach out to:
